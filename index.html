				<h3> A Brief History of Mass incarseration </h3>
				<P> The United States has a history of imprisonment that is unmatched in the world and is among the highest. The criminal justice system is in charge of almost five million individuals overall. Out of them, around two million people—a disproportionate number of Black people—live in jails and prisons rather than in their local neighborhoods. Compare this to the numbers from the early 1970s, when there were 360,000.The Impact of Mass Incarceration There is no proof that the extensive, decades-long investment in mass imprisonment is effective, which makes the social, moral, and financial consequences unjustifiable. The majority of the growth in correctional supervision is not due to crime, but rather to misguided changes in sentencing legislation and policy. For those who are incarcerated in large quantities, mass incarceration has a number of detrimental physical, psychological, and economic effects.
				Children whose parents are incarcerated suffer greatly; children's academic and health outcomes significantly drop when a parent is incarcerated. Excessive incarceration rates also cause community instability by causing the informal networks that act as barriers to local criminality to dissolve. When individuals of the community suffer from increased rates of victimization and lose friends, family, and other citizens to incarceration, their trust in law enforcement erodes. </P>

				<h3> <strong>The Surge in Prison  </strong></h3>

			<P> In 1972, the imprisonment rate was 93 per 100,000 people.11 The prison expansion that commenced in 1973 reached its peak in 2009, achieving a seven-fold increase over the intervening years. Between 1985 and 1995 alone, the total prison population grew an average of eight percent annually. And between 1990 and 1995, all states, with the exception of Maine, substantially increased their prison populations, from 13% in South Carolina to as high as 130% in Texas. The federal system grew 53% larger during this five-year period alone.12
			The number of people in prison began a marginal decline beginning in 201013 and continued along this course for more than a decade, including a remarkable 14% decline in 2020 alone, which was principally caused by accelerated releases and reduced admissions during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The year 2022, however, marked the first year in more than a decade where the prison population rose again, by two percent, led by increases in 36 states and the federal government. 14 Mississippi alone raised its population of imprisoned persons 15% between 2021 and 2022.<p/>

				Life and Long-Term Imprisonment

				Mass incarceration’s toll on human dignity is no more apparent than with the staggering proliferation of life sentences; today one in seven imprisoned people is serving a life sentence. Life sentences have consistently been included as a sentencing option, but their use expanded dramatically during the era of mass incarceration.28 Historically, life sentences came with the expectation of release; they were used to encourage good behavior among people who were incarcerated. Individuals were typically released in 10-15 years through parole or executive clemency.</p><br>

				<h3> Mass incarceration exists for multitudinous reasons</h3>
				<p> <strong>Exorbitant Bail </strong>- At any given time, about 500,000 people are imprisoned and awaiting trial because they cannot afford to pay bail and be released. According to research, those who are not in jail while awaiting trial are less likely to be convicted and, if convicted, less likely to be imprisoned. <br>
    			<strong>Mandatory Minimum sentence</strong>
    			 - Minimum sentence laws limit judges' authority to consider individual circumstances.<br>
    			 <strong>Three Strikes statutes</strong> - After a third criminal conviction, these statutes demand a penalty ranging from 25 years to life.<br>
    			<strong>"Truth" in Sentencing rules-</strong> These rules require those convicted of crimes to serve the majority of their sentences before being eligible for release.<br>
    			<strong>The War on Drugs –</strong> It’s been explicitly documented that policymakers understood the war on drugs would disproportionally affect people of color. Today, nearly 50 percent of incarcerated people in the federal system are in prison for drug offenses, and two-thirds of that population are people of color<br>
    			<strong>Harsh Punishment for Non-Violent Crimes Resulting in Increased Plea Bargaining –</strong> As mandatory minimums became more commonplace, more and more people charged with crimes increasingly opt to plea to lesser charges that still include imprisonment, even when they are innocent, rather than face incredibly harsh punishments if they’re convicted at trial.<br>
    			<strong>Problematic probation and parole - </strong> Strict probation and parole procedures result in many people being returned to prison for minor breaches. Nearly 25% of state prison admissions are due to probation infractions. <br>
    			<strong>Lack of mental health services -</strong>According to Mental Health America, roughly 1.2 million people in prison suffer from mental illnesses. Prison guards, who lack experience in dealing with mental health crises, resort to using force and solitary confinement, both of which have been shown to exacerbate mental health concerns.<br>
    			<strong>Longer penalties and more life sentences-</strong> One in every nine people now incarcerated is serving a life sentence, with one-third serving life without parole.<br>
				<strong>Private prisons and business motives -</strong> A large number of private contractors are financially driven.</p>
